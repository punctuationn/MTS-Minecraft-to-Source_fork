# MTS Minecraft to Source

An application that converts maps from Minecraft to the Source engine (e.g., for Garry’s Mod, Counter-Strike: Source, Team Fortress 2)

## 🔨 Recommended Tools

For map editing, I recommend **Hammer++** (an improved version of standard Hammer):

## ⚙️ Requirements

To run from source (`MTS_app.py`):

1. **Visual Studio Build Tools 2022**  
   📥 Download: [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)  
   During installation check:

   - Under _Desktop & Mobile_:
     - ☑️ Desktop Development with C++
     - ☑️ .NET desktop build tools
   - Under _Individual Components_:
     - ☑️ C++ 2022 Redistributable Update
     - ☑️ C++ CMake tools for Windows
     - ☑️ MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 build tools (Latest)
     - ☑️ C++ Build tools core features
     - ☑️ C++ core features
     - ☑️ Visual Studio SDK Build tools Core
     - ☑️ Windows 10 SDK (10.0.20348.0)
     - ☑️ Windows 11 SDK (10.0.22621.0)
     - ☑️ Windows Universal C Runtime

2. **Install Python Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install tk logging
   ```

   and

   ```bash
   pip install amulet-core
   ```

   💡 If you get errors with `amulet-core` (happens sometimes!):

   ```bash
   pip install amulet juju
   ```

3. **You're all set!** 🎉  
   In project root folder run:
   ```bash
   python MTS_app.py
   ```

**Linux Notice**  
🐧 Support for Linux WIP: Honestly, I don’t know, because I haven’t tested the app on Linux yet. I have absolutely no idea how compiling the 'amulet' API works on that system. On Windows, you need Visual Studio Build Tools 2022 for compilation, but how does that translate to Linux? Seriously, no clue—I’ll probably test it in the next few days.

## 🔧 Recommended Hammer Settings

For better texture scaling:  
`Tools > Options... > Game Configurations > Default texture scale: 0.1562`
